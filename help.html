                <p class="explanation">Join is a project management tool. It includes a kanban board which allows you to
                    work in a team and add
                    tasks for every team member.
                    By this, your team gets an overview about which task have to be done by whom, which are in progress
                    or are already
                    done.
                    By using drag and drop you can easily move a task card to a different column.
                    Join is a great tool for supporting you in your daily work.
                    <br> <br>
                    Get started by clicking on "Add task". Then choose a title and a description for your new task.
                    You may add various additional info like category, date and priority.
                    You can also assign the task to the team members which are already in your contact list or add new
                    contacts in the tab "contacts".

                    You can see all current tasks on the "board".
